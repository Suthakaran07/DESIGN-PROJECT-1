ABSTRACT:
Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) is an emerging wireless communication technology that utilizes 

visible light to transmit data. It provides high-speed, secure, and efficient data transfer by 

modulating light intensity to encode data. This technology offers a promising alternative 

to traditional Wi-Fi by leveraging the vast spectrum of visible light, which is relatively 

underutilized compared to radio waves. Li-Fi provides benefits such as higher data transfer 

rates, improved security due to line-of-sight communication, and reduced size component

interference, making it ideal for environments where radio frequency-based 

communication may face limitations. The technology employs LEDs as the light source for 

data transmission and photodiodes for reception, enabling faster and more energy efficient 

communication. This paper explores the principles, advancements, and applications of LiFi technology, highlighting its potential in fields such as healthcare, automotive, and smart 

cities

ABSTRACT:
A piezoelectric-based visitor sensing welcome mat is an innovative solution that utilizes 

piezoelectric sensors to detect and respond to the presence of individuals. These mats are 

equipped with piezoelectric materials that generate an electrical charge when subjected to 

pressure, allowing them to detect footsteps or other physical interactions. The primary 

application of such a system is in automating welcome messages or actions triggered by 

the entry of visitors into a designated area. This technology is particularly useful for smart 

homes, retail environments, or security systems, where it can serve as an unobtrusive and 

reliable means of detecting foot traffic. The piezoelectric sensors embedded within the mat 

convert mechanical energy into electrical signals, which are processed to determine the 

presence, weight, and even the number of individuals stepping onto the mat. The ability to 

integrate these mats with other smart systems enables a wide range of possibilities, from 

greeting visitors with personalized messages to activating security protocols.
